# Description

The SMF Theme Toggle mod lets you easily toggle between the forum default theme and an admin-designated secondary theme with a single click.

This mod works with any theme that allows new entries in the main & profile menus.

This mod works whether or not javascript is enabled on the client.

The requested change is persistent; it works by updating the user's requested theme on their profile.  Users must be allowed to select themes.

Note that menus are cached; you may need to clear cache for this mod to take effect.
